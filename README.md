# Assignment 1: Introduction to C# with Basic Functions
Welcome to your revised first assignment in C#.
You'll start with a basic "Hello World" program, then move on to using lists, flow control, and finally, functions. 
Remember, we're building up our skills step by step.

## Objectives:
 Write a simple "Hello World" program.
 Create and manipulate lists.
 Implement basic flow control.
 Understand and use simple functions.
 
## Tasks:
### 1. Hello World
Create a C# program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This will be your warm-up task without using functions.
### 2. Working with Lists
Create a list of integers.
Add at least five different numbers to your list.
Write a function PrintList that takes a list as a parameter and prints each number in the list to the console in a loop.
### 3. Flow Control with Functions
Write a function ClassifyNumber that takes an integer as a parameter and returns whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
In your main program, use this function to classify a set of numbers (e.g., -2, 0, 3, 5) and print the results to the console.
